Android application developed with the Java programming language.


<ul>

<li>
<b>Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?</b>
<p>The requirements of the application were to make an app that would allow a person to organize a list of items and keep track of their counts. The goal was to make a functional app, which I only halfway done. As it stands, the app has zero errors, but the app does not work the way that I want the app to work, as it does not currently show ANY items in the list.</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?</b>
<p>The UI designs were extremely simple. The more simple the design, the easier it is on the user. This made the app look good and function better. The screens that were needed included a login, signup, add item, and main page to display all the items. I added an SMS feature, which allowed the user to recieve a text if one of their items were low, but the items were not showing up correctly. So, I put it on a button just to make sure that the functionalit was there, and it runs flawlessly.</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?</b>
<p>I used a few different things programmatically. I made sure to have a SQLite Database. I used a Singleton Class. Both of these techniques can be used and expanded upon through various means. I made Constructors and classes to hold the data structures that the constructors would be used to construct. I allowed multiple different ways of submitting items to the constructor so that the application was more fluid. Finally; I made custom functions that were used by various TextViews and Buttons on my application.</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?</b>
<p>I should have used assertions, but I actually just made sure that the app worked the old-fashioned way, as the application was not that complex at the parts that require the users input to be examined. This process revealed that there are more bugs on some of the most simple code than can be counted. This process is important to make sure that the user can not break anything in the application.</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?</b>
<p>Most of the requirements for this assignment require using deprecated functions, so I had to program some things using permissions that were process differently due to the level of Android being used. This caused a BUNCH of headaches, but I had a lot of learning moments because of this.</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?</b>
<p>THE DESIGN COMPONENT. I am more of a design person that a programming person. I want to be a front end developer, and I want to dabble in back-end development. Seeing as though this application required me to be a full-stack developer, it is pretty quickly noticed that error is bound to happen. Anything that is relating to design is my expertise.</p>
